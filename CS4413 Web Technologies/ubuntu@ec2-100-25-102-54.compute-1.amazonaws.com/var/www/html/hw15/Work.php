		<p class="text-justify">My last full-time position was at Brooke Army Medical Center as a medic for the Air Force. The last location I worked at was on 3 West, a med-surg telemetry floor doing bedside patient care. I left the military in April of 2020 to pursue my degree. Since then, I have had one semester-long internship at the Security Operations Center at UTSA in 2021.
		<br/>Brooke Army Medical Center is the United States Army's premier medical institution. Located on Fort Sam Houston, BAMC, a 425-bed Academic Medical Center, is the Department of Defense's largest facility and only Level 1 Trauma Center. BAMC is also home to the Center for the Intrepid, an outpatient rehabilitation facility. The center is composed of ten separate organizations, including community medical clinics, centered around the Army's largest in-patient hospital. BAMC is staffed by more than 8,000 Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, Civilians, and Contractors providing care to wounded Service Members and the San Antonio Community at-large.
