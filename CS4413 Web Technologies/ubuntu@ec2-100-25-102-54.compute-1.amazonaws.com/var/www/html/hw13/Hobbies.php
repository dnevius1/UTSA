		<p class="text-justify">Recently I have been playing through Final Fantasy XIV's story line. I am still on the base game and it is enjoyable, but I have heard that the further into the expansions you go the better the story gets, so I am looking forward to that. I was playing World of Warcraft: Dragonflight when it released over the holidays, but I was starting to get bored because I mostly play solo and the endgame content is really only for people who have a group of friends to play with.
			Also, I have been trying to keep up with ICPC meetings and the challenges they put out but I don't think I am going to be able to attend many meetings this semester. My classes are very time consuming. Having several semester-long projects and homework assigned almost every class is making it difficult to spend time on any extra work.
			I was doing the same full body gym routine for almost two years up until recently. I was seeing great results with this routine, but my hips starting hurting and I found it was no longer sustainable, probably due to the amount of squatting I was doing. I decided about two weeks ago to switch to a foundations-type exercise where you hold a squat position with no weight for up to five minutes. So far, I have only been able to hold it for 2 minutes, but my lower body already feels better and more coordinated. The rest of my workout remains relatively the same. We will see how this fairs in the long run.
