			<h2>HOBBIES</h2>
			<p>Recently I have been playing through Final Fantasy XIV's story line. I am still on the base game and it is <br>enjoyable, but I have heard that the further into the expansions you go the better the story gets, so I <br>am looking forward to that. I was playing World of Warcraft: Dragonflight when it released over the <br>holidays, but I was starting to get bored because I mostly play solo and the endgame content is <br>really only for people who have a group of friends to play with. <br>
Also, I have been trying to keep up with ICPC meetings and the challenges they put out but I don't think I <br>am going to be able to attend many meetings this semester. My classes are very time consuming. <br>Having several semester-long projects and homework assigned almost every class is making it <br>difficult to spend time on any extra work. <br>
I was doing the same full body gym routine for almost two years up until recently. I was seeing great <br>results with this routine, but my hips starting hurting and I found it was no longer sustainable, <br>probably due to the amount of squatting I was doing. I decided about two weeks ago to switch to a <br>foundations-type exercise where you hold a squat position with no weight for up to five minutes. So <br>far, I have only been able to hold it for 2 minutes, but my lower body already feels better and more <br>coordinated. The rest of my workout remains relatively the same. We will see how this fairs in the <br>long run.
