			<h2>WORK</h2>
			<p>My last full-time position was at Brooke Army Medical Center as a medic for the Air Force. The last <br>location I worked at was on 3 West, a med-surg telemetry floor doing bedside patient care. I left the <br>military in April of 2020 to pursue my degree. Since then, I have had one semester-long internship at the <br>Security Operations Center at UTSA in 2021.<br>
			Brooke Army Medical Center is the United States Army's premier medical institution. Located on Fort <br>Sam Houston, BAMC, a 425-bed Academic Medical Center, is the Department of Defense's largest <br>facility and only Level 1 Trauma Center. BAMC is also home to the Center for the Intrepid, an <br>outpatient rehabilitation facility. The center is composed of ten separate organizations, including <br>community medical clinics, centered around the Army's largest in-patient hospital. BAMC is staffed <br>by more than 8,000 Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, Civilians, and Contractors providing care to wounded <br>Service Members and the San Antonio Community at-large.
