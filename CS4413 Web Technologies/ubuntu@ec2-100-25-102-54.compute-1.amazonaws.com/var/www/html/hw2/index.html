<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
<p>My name is <i>Daniel Nevius</i>, This is my first static webpage!</p>
<hr><h2>Degree of Study</h2></hr>
<p>
My degree of study is <q>Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering</q><br/>
My expected graduation date is December 2023. I have been attending UTSA since Summer of<br/>
2020 and I am excited to be almost done with the degree. I am still worried about passing<br/>
technical interviews though because I still don't feel like I know enough. There is always<br/>
something else you need to learn in this field to be useful to any companies and to stand<br/>
out as a candidate.

<hr><h2>Ideal Job & Research</h2></hr>

<p>
An ideal career fields for me would be working in a science lab doing scientific programming<br/>
 and modeling. Some specific fields would be aerospace with <dfn><abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr></dfn> or SpaceX or in medical research, biology or AI. <br/>
<abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr> is number one on my list. If I cannot land 
a job at <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>, I want to work on<br/>
 important cutting-edge research and be a part of something that changes the world for the better.<sub> (I also considered videogame design,
 but decided it was not impactful enough)</sub>
